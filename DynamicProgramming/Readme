After doing the LC DP problems, I've come up with a methodology that I find helps when I'm stuck on DP problems.
If stuck in the future, I should keep this "template of solving DP problems" in my mindset:

- depending on the number of parameters involved in the problem (typically 1 or 2), make a table or array with dimension equal to the number of parameters. So if param1 has range 0,.., i and param2 has range 0,..j then i rows, j columns.
- be sure to define the table, eg - what does DP[i][j] represent
- go through a sample input, and create the table accordingly.I find this immensely helpful in figuring out the equations that define the Dynamic Programming solution.
